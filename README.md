## 3D models

The characters we need will be moving around in a battle arena as seen in the screen shot below

The capsule scale is 0.75 (x,y,z) in Unity terms. 

As for the appearance of the characters we need a design similar to this:

We need 3 characters that look identical but have different colors. For instance the white, blue, red color seen in this image:

We have found a images of a Bomberman character in a T-stance to work from:

Finally we need the characters to have a walk cycle. We do not need animations such as punching, kicking etc. Simply walking that supports moving north, east, west and south. Sprite sheet for reference:
